# Template for Windows Based Git Bash Custom Scripts and Aliases

This project contains a simple script that is used to delete unused files from a git repository. It also contains the location and updated aliases.sh file for (Windows) git bash so that the command can be used anywhere. You need to update the path in the alias file to wherever git-file-cleanup.sh is located.

This can be used as a template to create new scripts and add global aliases for them in git bash.
